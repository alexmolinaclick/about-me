Welcome to my profile! I'm a web designer and developer from Latin America.

- I'm Alex Molina, a huge fan of global Internet innovation and open-source software, who has been working with web technologies and languages for the last 5 years. I've worked for several clients all around the world at web development and UX/UI design positions, enjoying the whole process and sharing life experiences with people from different backgrounds. I also love working on personal and cooperative projects to give back to the World the knowledge and experiences that have had a big influence on me.

- Iâ€™m interested in improving my skills and being up-to-date, for this reason I have been studying and working with the MERN, MEVN and LAMP stacks. Some projects and tools I love and use besides these are PUG, Tailwind, Shoelace CSS, Bulma CSS and Astro. I am not a perfectionist but I do consider myself a very disciplined and organized person so I'm quite caring about best practices, performance, methodologies and of course the work philosophies of the teams I've worked with.

My motto is to work on things with the LARC philosophy (Love, Art, Revolution and Care), which helps humanity and the planet as a whole. If you're interested in working with me, feel free to contact me thru my personal website, email or social media links:
